"I've seen a lot of shocking things in my time on the Force, but that pier... that's the kind of thing that makes you lose your faith in humanity!" "I've got to say it's the second worst thing I've ever seen." "Poor bastard down there is torn in two! By the looks of it, you'd think someone tied him to two horses and raced them in opposite directions. What could you have possibly seen that was worse than what's down there?" "It was about three years ago, up in Malibu, we found this guy on the beach. Looked like - I don't know - an animal attack." "Shark bite?" "No. I've seen shark bites, this was something different. Like whatever killed him knew what it was doing. The head was missing, the hands were missing, and... and there were these huge slashes, but..." "Bullshit!" "No, no, this guy was literally slashed to ribbons! The worst part was I was waiting for the meat wagon and I felt like something was watching me. I swear on my badge today that there was something just out of sight. And for a split second I thought about running to the squad car and getting the hell out of that place. To this day, it makes me wonder what's really out there..." "Ha! Maybe it was a werewolf - Whoooo!" "Alright, alright!" "Or a vampire - booh!" "Forget it! See, this is why you didn't get invited to Hernandez's wedding, Ted!"
