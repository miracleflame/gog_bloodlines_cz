"Brother Grünfeld seems particulary uneasy this evening." "Yes, LaCroix has begone to move more openly, and Brother Grünfeld grows impatient." "Ah yes, LaCroix. As always Brother Grünfeld focusses only on his old nemesis. Let us hope his fanatisism best serves the interests of our order, and not merely his own unresolved grievances." "Shhh, are you mad? Brother Grünfeld will not tolerate such insubordination, hold your tongue! You know upon whose direct autority he acts?" "Yes, I know. Far be it for me to question the ethic of the Holy See." "You would do best to remember your place! Brother Grünfeld is a faithful warrior. He's battled Satan's spawn for longer than you've been alive!" "Then I pray the Lord grant me the same years to fight in his army!" "Amen."
