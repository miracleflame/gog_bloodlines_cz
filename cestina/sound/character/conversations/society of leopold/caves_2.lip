"Are the stories true, about him I mean?" "Brother Grünfeld?" "Yes." "What stories have you heard, young brother?" "There are many, some say he saw his own mother eat alive by a coven of witches. And others that he once killed an elder vampire with his bare hands. There are even whispers that he is the resurrected St Leopold, come to lead his armies into the final battle against the armies of darkness." "Hehehe, not all stories you hear are true. Brother Grünfeld is a good soldier just as you'll become if you have faith in God and the discipline to stand in his army." "It is also said that he once killed a man of the brotherhood because he refused to follow orders." "Hmmm, some stories you hear are true, young brother."
