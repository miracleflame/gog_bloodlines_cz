"Everyone understands, right? Take the case halfway, and wait for 'em to do the same. They'll wanna see the money, but we can't let 'em." "'Cause it's filled with newspaper?" "Really, is that why? Ooh, I should smash you! Starting again. Bring the case out halfway, when they wanna see the money, you put it down in front of their guy. Soon as he reaches for it, you duck and grab his case. We'll be ready to open up on 'em. You get hit, it's your own fault." "What if their case is full of newspaper?" "Then at least we get to watch your illiterate ass try to read it later for laughs. I know they got it. Just don't ass it up, fool, or they gonna kill both of us."
