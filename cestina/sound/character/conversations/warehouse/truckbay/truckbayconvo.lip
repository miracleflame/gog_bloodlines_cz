"And once they come pick up the stash, they promised they'd make us just like them. Know what that means? That means we never die, we get super strong, we can even fly and shit." "We can even fly?" "Shhh, why not, don't they fly in the movies?" "Yeah, I guess so." "And, like, that punk who dropped your brother, you could hit his whole crew and the bullets wouldn't do Jack shit. I'd tear their asses up if I was a vampire." "Yeah, yeah, it's not so bad." "You'd be stupid not to run with this crew, they said they run whole cities, you understand that? Working with a crew that owns a whole city, you could do anything you want, kill anyone who gets in your way, fly all over the place." "But what about blood, do we really gotta drink blood?" "That's how they do it up in the movies." "That's kinda nasty, what if I want a sandwich or somethin'." "How should I know? Probably tastes good to vampires." "It's still nasty, what about sex? Don't tell me I gotta giving up hitting it, cause my cousin got her friend staying at my house and she..." "Man, how do you expect me to know, not like it falls off, right?" "Wha?" "You never use it anyway." "That's messed up." "Just keep your eyes open, man, we screw this shit up, kiss flying, sex and your ass goodbye. These Sabbat guys, they said they'd kill us and our families if we blow it." "I never agreed to..." "Look, just shut up and shoot anybody who ain't supposed to be here."
