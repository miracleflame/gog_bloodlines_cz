"I appreciate everyone's attendance here this night. It has been several years since I saw some of you. In that brief period of time several events have seen this family fall from the good graces of the head of the family back in Italy. The American Giovanni have been through hard times, this is true! The fall of the stock market, poor investments in several once tried and true industries. The loss of many old and dear friends in Washington who served our best interests. But I promise you, that after tonight these unfortunate mishaps will all be forgiven! The Ankaran Sarcophagus, you well may have heard about it's theft on the news. The truth of the matter is it was taken on my orders, why? It bears a great resemblance to an artifact said to contain the spirits of an entire kingdom wiped out during the time of the pharaohs. As I speak the most accomplished of our family are preparing to harvest this bounty of souls. Bringing the Giovanni family one step closer to the endless night we have toiled to bring about all these centuries! Once again, the American Giovanni are poised to make a grand return to a position of esteem. And to celebrate this momentous occasion, I have decided to embrace two of you, and to allow you to choose one person at this party to bestow the proxy kiss upon. When the others return, we shall inform Italy about our accomplishments and commence with the embrace. Let this night be the beginning of a prosperous new century! And let us not forget to thank God for this opportunity he's provided to regain face with our honored elders. Amen!"
