You have level one Dementation, known as Veil of Madness. Scroll the mouse wheel to select Veil of Madness, place your cursor over the guard, and use the Power key (default right-click) to activate the Disipline.
The Dementation effect will play on the guard, and he will go into a fit of uncontrollable laughter or start to cry. You can then walk past him."	// changed by wesp
