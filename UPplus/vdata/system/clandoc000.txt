The ritual the Tremere used to transform from living mages into undying monsters stripped them of their magic arts. To compensate, the vampires of Clan Tremere developed Thaumaturgy, the powerful Discipline of blood magic. The clan guards its secrets jealously and are the only Kindred to wield this powerful Discipline. The pursuit of arcane knowledge comes before all else, and the reliance upon it has weakened the bloodline. Tremere can raise no Physical Attribute above four points."	// changed by wesp
