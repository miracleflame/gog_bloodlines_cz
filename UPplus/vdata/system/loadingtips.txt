			The Giovanni are as much a family as they are a clan; the majority of their neonates are Embraced from clan members' mortal descendants. These insular Necromancers avidly pursue two goals: accumulating material wealth, and learning the secrets of Death itself."

			"Text"		"The Giovanni are respectable, genteel and well-mannered. Affluent beyond imagination, Clan Giovanni traces its roots back to before the Renaissance, to a family of merchant princes. No other Clan makes such a spectacle of humility and propriety as do the Giovanni. And no other clan hides its blasphemous secrets as well." // changed by wesp

			"Text"		"The Society of Leopold:
			The Inquisition exists today, though no official Church records speak of it. The Inquisition of the modern world is known as the Society of Leopold. Many of its members are researchers and occultists, but some are fanatic vampire-hunters who, in true Torquemada-esque fashion, mercilessly root out and destroy the \"spawn of Satan\"."

			"Text"		"Most Inquisitors are fanatic but spottily educated and trained, seldom posing any real threat. Likewise, most Inquisitors are mere mortals, with none of the supernatural powers attributed to saints. A few Inquisitors, though, actually manifest sufficient Faith to repel or even wound the Damned with their holy auras."

			"Text"		"In the Middle Ages, an Inquisition-led population alerted to vampires' depredations nearly wiped out the Kindred's millennia-old society. How much more easily, the Inner Circle shudderingly wonders, could a human population of six billion, armed with napalm, phosphorus rounds and nuclear weapons, dispose of the parasites in its midst?"
