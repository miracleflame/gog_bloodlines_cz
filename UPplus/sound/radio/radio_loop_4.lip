- Deb, Deb, this is really serious now, can I finish? Alright. Everyone knows they've got cameras at every stoplight so the government can keep tabs on our comings and goings. But did you know that they then sold access to their data bases to the Illuminati, who has been using that information to compile a list of the most frequently travelled routes and then opening new locations of their well known chain of coffee houses in the most profitable locations? And did you also know that they use those funds to surpress fusion and solar power?

And train your clone to assasinate you and assume your identity, should you go poking your nose into the whole global warming business.
- Thank you Gomez.
I hate to interrupt this mentally stimulating conversation, but the people who keep me chained to the console at this radio station, in my underwear no less, want you to spend money on this stuff.
