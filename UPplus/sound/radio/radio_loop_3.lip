The moon is out, everyone's in dreamland and you've tuned into The Deb of Night. Nobody to fall asleep next to you? Go ahead and pull the radio into bed, that's what I'm here for. And hey, why don't you call me some time? Area code 323, KL5-KTRK. Looks like somebody's been waiting in the queue quite a while to speak to yours truly.

- So caller, why aren't you asleep?
- Uhm... uh, insects.
- Insects... as in you have an insect problem? Or chirping crickets are keeping you up? Or you have nightmares about them? Help me out here.
- No, no, no. Don't you know? When you fall asleep, they can crawl into your mouth or your ears, or... or your nose. You-you can't prevent it if you're asleep. I-I mean, you - what can you do?
- Are there any scientists out there listening to this?

PHRASE char 430 "
- Uhm, I-I read something, I-I don't know where, but do you know the average person eats several pounds of insects a year? The majority of that weight is composed of roaches, ants and spiders. Just knowing that as soon as you close your eyes, a big fat centipede is gonna drop into your mouth and crawl down your throat, I-I-I can't do it. I never sleep at night!
- You know, they voluntarily eat insects in some countries.
" 49 74

- Yeah, well, those countries probably need Jesus.
- So you never sleep at night, I assume you do sleep, right?

- And what exactly do you do?
- I'm a middle school teacher.

- Uhm, I'm a writer, Deb.
- So have you written any movies I might have seen?
- Well, I actually haven't finished any screenplays yet.
- I see. So, have you done any other kinds of writing?
- Well, just some outlines right now, but I've got some really good ideas for some stories that are crawling around in the old noggin.
- So if you haven't really written anything, how can you call yourself a writer? Because I once fixed my toilet doesn't make me a plumber, right?
" 98 129

PHRASE char 449 "
- Well, you see...
- Is there anyone in this city that doesn't call themselves a writer or actor or a director? Don't you think you're doing a disservice to those who actually make their living in those art forms by deeming yourself something you're not, or not even trained to do?
- Uhm, well, I think I'm pretty good at knowing what's good writing from bad writing.
- Oh, wouldn't that make you a critic?
Let's see if anyone else agrees.

- Uh-huh.
- And then, like, something happens, and the girl agent gets kidnapped by the killer.
" 176 201

PHRASE char 429 "
- «Something happens».
- Yeah, well, I haven't quite figured it out yet, but, like, the guy agent notices, like, how the killer seems to know everything he's doing, like, one step ahead of him. And then there's this kind of... you know, weird chase scene, and then, like, we find out that the guy's got two personalities. And, like, he finds out in the end that he's the killer!

- Uhm, Wisconsin.
- Okay. I want you to get all your stuff together, and then I want you to move back to Wisconsin.

And if anyone was thinking of asking what I'm wearing, that number again is 323-KL5-KTRK. We're going to take a short commercial break, but that doesn't mean you can stop thinking about me. Don't go anywhere, boys.
