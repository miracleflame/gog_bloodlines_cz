Cstools

Tools for dealing with Czech texts in Perl. I will be glad if anybody suggests to make these methods more general, including more languages and/or charsets. Maybe we should put these into the Convert:: namespace?

Download Cstools-3.44.tar.gz, the latest release.

This package includes modules and programs that are usefull when dealing with Czech (and Slovak) texts in Perl.
Modules

Cz::Cstocs
    Implements object for various charset encodings, used for the Czech language -- either as objects, or as direct conversion functions. One of the charsets is tex for things like \v{c}. 
Cz::Sort
    Sorts according to Czech sorting conventions, regardless on locale setting. Exports functions czcmp and czsort which can be used in similar way as as Perl's internals cmp and sort. 

Programs (command line utilities)

cstocs
    This version of popular charset reencoding utility uses the above mentioned module to convert text between various charsets. 
cssort
    Command line utility which sorts input lines according to rules used in the Czech language. 

INSTALLATION

Download the tar.gz, unpack it, change to the Cstools-* directory. Then do

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

or you can use CPAN module and just type "install Cz::Cstocs".
