Who seemed to step from shadow to shadow like through a door! Is it a Lasombra? But what is he doing here in LA? Is it about Beckett's sarcophagus? I'll better follow him around the next few nights, just to be on the safe side."

I followed him and was met by a bouncer who asked if I'd been enlightened. I wasn't, so he didn't let me in. I had to comply. Later the new agent of the prince entered it, soon after the bouncer ran out in panic and into the sewers! I followed him all the way to Santa Monica where he then visited the smoke shop to relax."

I was still watching the place when, again, the agent of the prince arrived. Suddenly the Kindred stepped out of a shadow nearby! I hope I wasn't spotted. He took a cab back to the library."
